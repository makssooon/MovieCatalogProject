MovieCatalog is the application that helps users save information about a 
movie as well as to leave comments about it prior to and after watching. 
Additionally, the app offers the list of the world’s top-rated movies. At 
this stage it contains several pictures that I regard as excellent and 
highly-recommended to see.

Some of the app’s functionality:

Adding information about the movie
 - A new movie can be added using the button in the screen’s top right corner.
 - By pressing the image area users can choose a movie poster from the 
	gallery (a default poster will be used in case no image is selected).
- Users can input any title, genre, and movie director, as long as these 
	fields are not left empty.
 - Release date can be selected with the help of the date picker keyboard that 
	has 2 limitations: the field cannot be left empty, and the date cannot 
	be earlier than 14.10.1888.
 - The about field should contain any text and should not include the standard 
	sentence "add movie description...".
 - The app will notify the user if any information input was invalid. 
	Fields with invalid data will be marked red.
 
Viewing movie-related information
 - When clicking a movie thumbnail (cell) in the main menu a page containing 
	movie related information will appear.
 - If a user-created movie was selected the ‘Edit’ button will show up.

Searching the film catalog
 - Search bar can be found after scrolling to the top of the page or pressing 
	the search button in the screen’s top left corner.
 - The search results only display user-added movies.
 - Segmented control, which helps to select search criteria, can be found under 
	the search bar.

 - For the ease of navigating, the main menu features a button that takes the 
	user to the top of the list.
